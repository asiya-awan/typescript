var someValue = "this is a string";
//Type assertions have two forms. One is the “angle-bracket” syntax:
var strLength0 = someValue.length;
var strLength1 = someValue.length;
console.log("strLength0: " + strLength0);
console.log("strLength: " + strLength1);
// And the other is the as-syntax:
var strLength2 = someValue.length;
console.log("strLength: " + strLength2);
